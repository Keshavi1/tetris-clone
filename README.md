# tetris-clone

Hello, I have made a tetris clone and i desided to do it in pygame instead of c++. I just wanted to take a litle break from c++ and opengl But I think I'm almost ready to return to c++. it's just such a tiring language compared to python.

Anyway, this is tetris, and a very basic version of it at that. I don't really have much more to say so I'm gona disappear for a few months. bye.
